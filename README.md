# Smarty jdate plugin

Smarty is an old template engine that some scripts use as their template system

Saddly theres no official plugin for jalali date support

### Why

Recently i had to work with this engine for a client so after some research i came across this issue.

## Installation

Clone the repo and copy everything from `plugin` to your `/path/to/smarty/plugins`

## Usage

```smarty
{$row['id']|jdate_format:"%Y/%m/%d"}
```

## Note

This project was not created by me how ever theres no repo or even download links for it.

basically its an abandoned project
